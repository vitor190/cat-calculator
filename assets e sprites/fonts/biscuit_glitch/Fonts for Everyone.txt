Fonts for Everyone — Just €2 Whether you’re designing packaging, rocking a t-shirt line, building an app, or crafting a killer poster — once you've paid €2, you're free to use the font however you like.


We believe typography should be accessible to all, no matter the project type. No restrictions, no fine print — just creative freedom, plain and simple.

Because good design belongs to everyone!
